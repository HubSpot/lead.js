## Key Bindings

The most important bindings are:

* `Shift + Enter`: Execute the current cell and create a new one underneath
* `Ctrl + Enter`: Execute the current cell and keep the cursor there
* `F1`: Show help for the command under the cursor
* `Ctrl + Space`: Suggest a function or metric. Inside a string, this will suggest metric names. Elsewhere, it will suggest available functions.

Get a list of all key bindings using the `keys` command.
